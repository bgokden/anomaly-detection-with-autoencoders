Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders - Credit Card Fraud Case

Blog post for this repo: https://blog.berkgokden.com

Code is based on: https://medium.com/swlh/anomaly-detection-with-autoencoders-2bd23dedbd9e
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Download data from Kaggle

To plot the input data:
```
python part1.py
```

To train the model and plot sample data:
```
python part2.py
```

Model will be saved as 'autoencoder.h5'.
